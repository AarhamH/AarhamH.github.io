  description:"I am a *fourth year CS Student @ SFU*, expecting to graduate in May 2025. I have a passion for *problem solving* and interest in building services that cater to the needs of many people. As a developer, I have honed skills in various technologies and have had extensive real world experience in software teams.\n As an application developer at Modrinth, I worked extensively with *Rust* in building middleware services for the Theseus client and providing compatibility with the user's native JRE, along with work in the client side by building interactive UIs with *Vue.js*. In my spare time, I have gained development experience with *C#* and *C++* in Windows development environments, and have used technologies such as ASP.NET, WPF, and CMake. I also enjoy exploring the functional world by experimenting with Haskell and Lisp. Apart from building software, I enjoy classical music, basketball, and poking trees.",
