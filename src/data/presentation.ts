Nearing 2 years software engineering experience, I have worked in diverse software teams and expanded my domain knowledge in an array of technologies, software patterns, and techniques. I mainly work in Go, but also loved hacking around with Rust and Haskell. Apart from software, I enjoy classical music, preacher curls, and poking trees.",
